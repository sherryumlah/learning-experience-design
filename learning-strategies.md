# Learning Strategies — Definitions + Examples
## Spaced Practice

### Definition:
Reviewing and revisiting information at increasing intervals over time to strengthen long-term memory.

### Why it works:
Spacing creates “desirable difficulty,” which improves retention compared to cramming.

### Example:
Instead of a single 2-hour training on safety procedures, learners review key points briefly on Day 1, Day 3, Day 7, and Day 21 through short quizzes or micro-lessons.

## Retrieval Practice

### Definition:
Actively recalling information from memory without looking at notes or answers.

### Why it works:
The act of retrieval strengthens memory more than re-reading or reviewing.

### Example:
Learners complete a short quiz or write down everything they remember about a topic before reviewing the lesson content.

## Elaboration

### Definition:
Explaining ideas in your own words and connecting new information to existing knowledge or experiences.

### Why it works:
Elaboration deepens understanding and builds stronger mental connections.

### Example:
After learning a new concept, learners explain how it applies to their own job or teach it to a peer using their own examples.

## Interleaving

### Definition:
Mixing related topics or problem types during practice rather than focusing on one at a time.

### Why it works:
Helps learners recognize patterns and choose the correct approach in real-world situations.

### Example:
In customer service training, learners practice handling billing issues, technical issues, and emotional customers in a mixed sequence rather than in separate blocks.

## Concrete Examples

### Definition:
Using specific, real-world examples to explain abstract or complex concepts.

### Why it works:
Concrete examples make concepts easier to understand and apply.

### Example:
Instead of defining “cognitive load” abstractly, show a cluttered slide versus a clean slide and discuss how each affects learning.

## Dual Coding

### Definition:
Presenting information using both verbal (text/audio) and visual formats.

### Why it works:
Engages multiple processing channels, improving comprehension and recall.

### Example:
A short narrated video that combines diagrams, icons, and spoken explanations rather than text alone.
