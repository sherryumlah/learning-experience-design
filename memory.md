# Cognitive Load Theory
The three stages of memory are:
1. **Encoding** - the brain perceives and is selective. It's influenced by emotional connection, novel/unique/suprising concepts, and attention.
2. **Storage** - how we consolidate what we've processed and create memory traces
3. **Retrieval** - the act of remembering and bringing a memory trace back to the front of our mind.

## Assumptions
Cognitive load theory is based on two assumptions:
1. Working memory is driven by your prefrontal cortex processor. It has a limited capacity. (You can hold 7 items at a time. Any more than this = cognitive overload.)
2. Our ability to use information already stored in longterm memory is unlimited.
