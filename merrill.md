# Merrill's First Principles of Instruction
Merrill's principles embody the essential elements of learning models and theories like ADDIE, andragogy, Gagne's Nine Events, and the Explicit Model.

**Problem-Centered:** Learning is promoted when learners are engaged in solving a real-world problem.

**Activate Prior Knowledge:** New knowledge is built upon existing knowledge. 

**Demonstration:** Learners need to see new skills demonstrated. 

**Application:** Learners need opportunities to practice the new skill. 

**Integration:** Learners need to integrate the new knowledge into their real-world context.
