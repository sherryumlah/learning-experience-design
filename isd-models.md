# Instructional Design Models

## ADDIE

A classic, linear (but often iterative) instructional design framework.

- Analyze – Identify learner needs, goals, constraints, and success criteria

- Design – Plan learning objectives, assessments, content structure, and strategies

- Develop – Create learning materials and activities

- Implement – Deliver or launch the learning experience

- Evaluate – Measure effectiveness and make improvements (formative and summative)

## SAM (Successive Approximation Model)

An agile, iterative alternative to ADDIE, focusing on rapid prototyping, constant feedback, and continuous improvement

- Preparation Phase - gather information, identify the problem, savvy start (brainstorm/sketch/prototype), 

- Iterative Design Phase: Design → Prototype → Evaluate – Rapid cycles of building, testing, and refining

- Iterative Development Phase: Develop → Implement → Evaluate – Build and refine the final solution in beta groups

## Backward Design

Designing learning by starting with the end goal in mind.

- Identify Desired Results – What should learners know or be able to do? Identify clear learning objectives, skills, knowledge, or understanding the learners should have at the end.

- Determine Acceptable Evidence – How will learners demonstrate success? Design activities that help you know they've learned it (quizzes, projects, simulations, peer reviews).

- Plan Learning Experiences & Instruction – Design activities and content to achieve the outcomes

## SAM + Backward Design (Hybrid)
(Outcome-first, iterative, prototype-driven)

- Discover & Frame (SAM: Preparation)

- Define Outcomes & Evidence (Backward Design)

- Savvy Start + Rapid Prototyping (SAM)

- Design Learning Experiences (Backward Design → SAM)

- Iterative Design Cycles (SAM)

- Iterative Development Cycles (SAM)

- Finalize, Launch, Evaluate
