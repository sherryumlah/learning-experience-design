# SAM + Backward Design Hybrid Model
(Outcome-first, iterative, prototype-driven)

### Phases
1. Discover & Frame (SAM: Preparation)
2. Define Outcomes & Evidence (Backward Design)
3. Savvy Start + Rapid Prototyping (SAM)
4. Design Learning Experiences (Backward Design → SAM)
5. Iterative Design Cycles (SAM)
6. Iterative Development Cycles (SAM)
7. Finalize, Launch, Evaluate

## Discover & Frame

**Goal:** Understand the real problem before designing anything.

**Key Questions:**

### Business & Context

- Why does this learning need to exist now?
- What happens if we don’t solve this problem?
- What does success look like for the organization?

### Learners / Audience

- Who are the learners (roles, experience level, environment)?
- What do they struggle with today?
- What do they already know or do well?

### Constraints

- Time, budget, tools, LMS, accessibility, legal/compliance?
- Delivery format (async, live, blended)?

### Activities

- Stakeholder interviews
- Learner interviews or surveys
- Review existing materials or performance data

### Outputs

- Problem statement
- Learner personas or profiles
- Constraints list

## Identify the Learning Problem (Not the Solution)

**Goal:*** Avoid “they want a course” syndrome.

**Key Questions:**

- Is this a knowledge, skill, behavior, or environment problem?
- What are learners doing incorrectly today?
- What should they be doing instead?

### Problem Statement Template
> [!Note]
> Learners currently [current behavior].
> This results in [negative outcome].
> They need to be able to [desired performance] in order to [business goal].

### Outputs

- Clear learning/performance problem
- Alignment with business goals

## Identify Desired Results (Backward Design – Stage 1)

**Goal:** Define what learners must do, not just know.

**Key Questions:**

- What should learners be able to do differently after this experience?
- What does successful performance look like on the job?
- What decisions should learners be able to make?

### Outcome Writing Formula

> [!Note]
> Given [context], learners will be able to [observable action] to [standard or outcome].

### Activities

- Rewrite vague goals into measurable outcomes
- Rank outcomes by importance (Must / Nice to Have)

### Outputs

- Clear, measurable learning outcomes
- Prioritized outcome list

## Determine Acceptable Evidence (Backward Design – Stage 2)

**Goal:** Decide how success will be proven before designing content.

**Key Questions:**

- How will we know learners can do this?
- What would convincing evidence look like?
- Can this be demonstrated, not just stated?

### Evidence Types

- Scenarios or simulations
- Case studies or role plays
- Performance tasks
- Quizzes (only when appropriate)

### Activity

- Assessment Mapping: Outcome → Evidence → Criteria for success

### Outputs

- Assessment plan
- Rubrics or success criteria

## Savvy Start / Design Thinking Session (SAM)

**Goal:** Align stakeholders and generate solution ideas quickly.

### Savvy Start Mini-Agenda (60–90 min)

1. Alignment (15 min)
- Review problem statement
- Review desired outcomes & evidence

2. Brainstorm (20–30 min)
- What types of learning experiences could support this?
- What have we seen work before?
- What should we absolutely avoid?

3. Sketch & Prototype (20–30 min)
- Sketch screens, flows, or interactions
- Storyboard a scenario or module
- Whiteboard the learner journey

4. Decide (10–15 min)
- What will we prototype first?
- What assumptions need testing?

### Outputs
- Low-fidelity prototypes or sketches
- Agreed-upon direction

## Plan Learning Experiences & Instruction (Backward Design – Stage 3)

**Goal:** Design activities that directly support outcomes and evidence.

**Key Questions:**

- What practice do learners need to succeed?
- Where can we use retrieval, scenarios, or examples?
- How will learners get feedback?

### Design Considerations
- Learning strategies (retrieval, spacing, elaboration)
- Accessibility and inclusivity
- Cognitive load management

### Outputs
- Learning experience map or storyboard
- Activity-level design plan

## Iterative Design Cycles (SAM)

**Goal:** Validate ideas early and often.

### Design Iteration Activities
- Review storyboards with SMEs
- Usability testing with sample learners
- Feedback on flow, clarity, and alignment

**Key Questions:**

- Does this support the outcomes?
- Is anything unnecessary or confusing?
- Are learners practicing what matters?

### Outputs
- Revised designs
- Documented feedback and decisions

## Iterative Development Cycles (SAM)

**Goal:** Build in increments, not all at once.

### Activities
- Develop one module or interaction at a time
- Conduct pilot tests or soft launches
- Gather learner data and feedback

**Key Questions:**

- Does the experience function as intended?
- Are learners engaged and challenged?
- Are assessments measuring the right things?

### Outputs
- Functional learning assets
- Refined assessments

## Finalize, Launch & Evaluate

**Goal:** Ensure the solution works and continues to improve.

### Activities
- Final QA (content, accessibility, technical)
- Launch plan and learner communication
- Post-launch evaluation

### Evaluation Levels
- Learner reaction
- Learning evidence
- On-the-job performance impact

### Outputs
- Final learning experience
- Evaluation plan and insights
